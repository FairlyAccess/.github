### About

**FairlyAccess** is an open source initiative focused on building inclusive, barrier-free digital experiences.

Weâ€™re just getting started &#8211; but our goal is clear: To help developers build a web that works for everyone.

### Early Stage

This project is currently in active development. We're laying the foundation &#8211; one accessible line of code at a time.

If you're passionate about digital inclusion, now is a great time to get involved and help shape the direction.

### Get Involved

We welcome contributors of all backgrounds. Whether you're writing code, improving documentation, or testing accessibility &#8211; you're part of the mission.

- Stay tuned for first issues and contribution guidelines.
- Discussions and roadmap coming soon.

_No barriers in our tools. No barriers in our team._
